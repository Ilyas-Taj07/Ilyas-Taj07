# Ilyas Taj - Personal Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find my personal projects showcasing various web development technologies including HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and SQL Server. These projects are the result of my passion for coding and exploring new concepts.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of my key projects:

### 1. [**Spotify Clone**](https://spotify-clone-three-wheat-19.vercel.app/)

A front-end clone of Spotify built using **React.js**, featuring a clean and modern UI inspired by the official Spotify website. The music player streams audio from local files stored in the public folder, ensuring playback functionality even after the app is built and deployed.

### 2. [**Myntra Clone**](https://myntra-clone-tawny-pi.vercel.app/)

A clone of **Myntra**, an online fashion shopping platform. This project uses **React.js** for the UI and is designed to replicate Myntra's main features like product listings, filters, and a shopping cart.

### 3. [**Retrofun**](https://retrofun-ilyas.netlify.app/)

**Retrofun** is a web socket-based retrospective app for agile teams. Built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, it allows team members to join a room and collaboratively reflect on the current sprint in real-time via **WebSockets**.

### 4. [**Pickit**](https://pickit-tool.vercel.app/)

**Pickit** is a developer tool for extracting color **hex codes** from any image. Users can upload an image, paste a URL, or paste a screenshot, then use a pointer to grab any color from the image. It also includes a **PX to REM converter** and vice versa, making it especially useful for responsive design workflows.

### 5. [**Flickpad**](https://expo.dev/accounts/ilyas_taj/projects/flickpad) *(Mobile App)*

A simple yet effective notepad app built with **React Native Expo**, offering two core features:

- **Notes** ‚Äì For quickly jotting down ideas or content.
- **Checklists** ‚Äì Create task lists and stay organized.

A unique feature of **Flickpad** is the ability to **lock notes with a password**, ensuring your sensitive content stays private.
