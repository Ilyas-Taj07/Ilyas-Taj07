# Ilyas Taj - Personal Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find my personal projects showcasing various web development technologies including HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and SQL Server. These projects are the result of my passion for coding and exploring new concepts.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of my key projects:

### 1. **[Spotify Clone](https://spotify-clone.vercel.app)**

### 2. **[Myntra Clone](https://myntra-clone.vercel.app)**

A clone of **Myntra**, an online fashion shopping platform. This project uses **React.js** for the UI and is designed to replicate Myntra's main features like product listings, filters, and a shopping cart.

### 3. **[Retrofun](https://retrofun.vercel.app)**

**Retrofun** is a web socket-based application where team members can join a room and perform a retrospective for the current sprint. Built using **React.js** and **WebSockets**, this app helps teams in agile development reflect and discuss the previous sprint in a collaborative manner.

### 4. **[Pickit](https://pickit-tool.vercel.app)**

**Pickit** is a tool that lets you extract color **hex codes** by uploading an image, pasting a URL, or pasting a screenshot. It also features a **PX to REM converter** for responsive design. A simple yet powerful tool for web developers and designers.
